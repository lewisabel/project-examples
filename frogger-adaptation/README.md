# Frogger Classic Adaptation

This is an adaptation of the classic arcade game "Frogger". It uses the p5.js library as well as collide2d to create a two player experience where one person is the frog trying to cross to the other side and the other creates obstacles (similar to the cars in the arcade game) to try and hit the frog.

### Techniques

- JavaScript
- p5.js library
- p5.collide2d.js library
- Object-Oriented Programming

### Planning to Implement

- Scoring system
- Use of sprites
- Deferent types of obstacles available (e.g. power downs)
- Cool down period to create obstacles (that varies based on who is winning)
